My macOS configuration files.


Most setup steps are in `.install.sh`

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alescontrela/dotfiles/master/.install.sh)
```


SketchyBar Setup
----------------------
The present config for sketchybar is done entirely in lua (and some C), using
[SbarLua](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SbarLua).
One-line install for sketchybar config (requires brew to be installed):
```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FelixKratz/dotfiles/master/install_sketchybar.sh | sh
```
